# ClickyGame

### ClickyGame is a simple and fun memory game with an attractive UI, built using React.js.

**Purpose:**  To demonstrate React-based, front-end development skills by breaking the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

**Application Features:**
 * Render an array of images.
 * Set each image to listen for click-events.
 * Track user-score (increment when an image is clicked for the first time / set to zero if same image is clicked more than once).
 * Display images in random order. Shuffle images at-random after each click-event.
 * Restart game when user's score is reset after an incorrect guess.
